                  <p>I just wanted to say how pleased with are with our new Mars air purifier. We have been using it now for around 6 weeks and are really impressed with the system. It keeps the air flow in our piercing studio clean and fresh and also gives extra confidence to both our body piercer and customers, particularly it situations when customers need to remove their masks for piercing. We would 100% recommend this unit to other companies and in particular close contact services such as ourselves and places like tattooists and beauticians.</p>
