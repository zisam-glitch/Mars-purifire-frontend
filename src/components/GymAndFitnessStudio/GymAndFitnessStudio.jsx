                            <p>In gyms and sports centers, HEPA air filtration is used to create safe spaces by filtering out the transmission of diseases (such as COVID-19 or flu and colds). With a Mars Air Purifier gyms and sports centers can also provide clean air zones with no offensive smells thanks to our advanced air purification technologies – creating secure and healthy environments for both employees and clients.<br /><br />Indoor air quality is often deteriorated in gyms, swimming pools, and any other sports facility due to the activity that takes place there: cycling rooms, bodybuilding, fitness classes. martial arts, cardio, etc. It’s become increasingly important to promote environmental cleanliness while also improving health and sense of security and well-being.<br /><br />In high-traffic, high-volume rooms with significant activity, where people are physically active or stay for an extended amount of time, ensuring adequate fresh air supply is difficult. Germs and viruses spread even more when you simply flip the switch on an air conditioning or ventilation system that has a clogged filter or there’s a lack of free-flowing air.<br /> <br />In every scenario, air purification may help to save lives by protecting people from dangerous infections or high-risk groups. Our air purifiers, such as the Mars Purifier Generation Z are perfectly suited for health spas – massage rooms, therapy spaces, waiting areas, reception areas, gyms, fitness studios, as well as other areas like reception, exercise rooms, machine rooms</p>

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Carbon air filters can be effective at filtering VOCs from the air. These are gaseous substances that most other mechanical filters like HEPA filters, cannot touch. Some of the gases in cigarette smoke or those given off by drying paint or cleaning products can be removed from the air by a carbon filter.
